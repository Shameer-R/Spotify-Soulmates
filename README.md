# Spotify Soulmates
This web app checks the compatibility of two users based on their music tastes on Spotify. I made this project to gain more of an understanding of how the back-end and front-end communicate.

# Usage
Currently spotify user ID's are required to use this web app. They can be found at the end of a spotify user url.

Example - spotify.com/user/**l5x74zkz5jru3g2v6od993am5**
